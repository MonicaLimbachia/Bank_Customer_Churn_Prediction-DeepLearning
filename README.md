# Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project is centered on predicting customer churn within a banking context using deep learning methodologies. Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for banks, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By leveraging advanced neural network techniques, this project aims to provide a robust model that can accurately identify customers who are at risk of leaving, enabling banks to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Dataset:** I used a comprehensive dataset that includes various features related to customer demographics, account information, and transaction history.
- **Data Cleaning:** I meticulously cleaned the data by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features to ensure that the model could learn effectively from the data.
- **Feature Encoding:** Categorical features were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding and label encoding, making them suitable for model input.
- **Feature Scaling:** I applied StandardScaler to normalize the data, ensuring all features were on the same scale for optimal model performance.

### 2. Model Development
- **Model Selection:** I opted for a deep learning approach using a fully connected neural network, which is well-suited for handling structured tabular data.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Input Layer:** The preprocessed features are fed into the model.
  - **Hidden Layers:** Dense layers with ReLU activation functions help the model learn complex patterns in the data.
  - **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function provides the probability of a customer churning.
- **Training:** I trained the model using binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. To prevent overfitting, I incorporated techniques like early stopping and dropout.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Metrics:** The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the AUC-ROC curve. These metrics provided a comprehensive view of the model's ability to predict churn effectively.
- **Validation:** I used a train-test split to assess the model's generalization capabilities, and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance.

### 4. Deployment
- **Streamlit App:** To make the model accessible, I developed a Streamlit app that allows users to input customer data and receive real-time churn predictions. This was a rewarding way to see my work come to life in an interactive format.

## Conclusion
This project has been an enriching experience, helping me deepen my understanding of deep learning and its application in the financial industry. The model developed here provides valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing banks to take proactive measures to retain customers at risk of churning.
